### What I learned

For simple projects like this with style guides, I can add the most repeated styles to the * to form the baseline of my CSS.

```css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    line-height: 150%;
    letter-spacing: 0px;
    font-family: "FigTree", serif;
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    font-weight: 500;
}
```
